# CAN Robot Framework Project

## Overview
This project demonstrates sending and receiving **CAN messages** using **Python** and **Robot Framework**.  
It uses a **virtual CAN bus** for testing, so no physical hardware is required.

---

## Features
- Send CAN messages with a specified **arbitration ID** and **data payload**.  
- Receive CAN messages with a **timeout**.  
- Fully automated tests using **Robot Framework**.  
- Virtual CAN bus allows safe testing without hardware.
